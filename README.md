## About the Project

This project is the capstone assignment for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.  
It applies data science methodologies and Python programming to solve a real-world problem, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

**Objectives:**
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python for data science tasks.
- Apply the data science workflow from data acquisition to insights.
- Communicate findings through visualizations and written analysis.

---

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Machine learning model training and evaluation (if applicable)
- Insights and recommendations based on findings
- Well-documented code with comments

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (if used)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for running the code)

---

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gee-46/<your-repo-name>.git
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

- Open the main Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) to view and run the code.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to reproduce the analysis.
- Modify input files or parameters as needed for your own experiments.

## Example Output

Below is a sample of the type of output produced by this project:

```python
# Sample visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.title('Sample Plot')
plt.show()
```

*Add actual charts, tables, or model results here from your project as examples.*
